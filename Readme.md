# Welcome to this Pokemon Fan Website

## How was the website made ?

This website was made using 2 APIs. The "Pokeapi" and the "Jikan.moe" APIs.

## What information can you get on the website ?

On this website, you can view lists of pokemons made according to their generations. After choosing a generation to display the pokemon list, you can choose to sort the pokemons by type. The pokemon cards colors are defined according to their types so you can visualy see which type each pokemon is. By clicking a pokemon card you can hear the pokemon's sound so make sure to turn up your volume for a better experience (I personnally recommend trying the Eevee and Pikachu sounds). When you click on the card, you can also see a description of the Pokemon.

When you reach the bottom of the page, you can see a card describing the pokemon anime of the respective generation.
